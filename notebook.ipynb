This means tracking three numbers: the x and y locations of the turtle, and its angle in degrees.\n\nUpdating the location when angles are involved uses some trigonometry, so let's load `sin` and `cos`.

Each transformation rule specifies a character and a string. Each time the rule's character appears in the axiom, it is replaced with the rule's string. Characters in the axiom which do not have a rule are left alone.\n\nIn Python, we can represent the transformation rules as a dictionary. Each transformation rule is represented as an entry with the character as key and replacement string as value.\n\nFor example, the rules\n- `a → aba`\n- `c → bb`\n\nAre represented in Python as `{'a': 'aba', 'c': 'bb'}`.

One way to think of these commands is that they give our simulated turtle a sense of memory. The `'['` command tells the turtle to stay still but remember its current location (including the angle). The `']'` command tells it to go to the last remembered location. Once the turtle goes back to a remembered location it promptly forgets about it, so then the next time `']'` is called it goes to the last remembered location *before that*.
